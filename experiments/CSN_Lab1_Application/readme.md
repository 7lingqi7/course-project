## üåê Application Layer Protocols Lab

This project explores the fundamentals of **application-layer network protocols** through three hands-on Python assignments:

### 1. HTTP Web Server
Build a basic HTTP server that listens on a custom port, handles file requests, and responds with either the file content or a 404 error using TCP sockets.

### 2. UDP Ping Tool
Implement a UDP-based client-server system to:
- Send and receive ping messages
- Measure Round Trip Time (RTT)
- Simulate packet loss for unreliable transmission scenarios

### 3. Simple FTP System
Develop a simplified FTP protocol over TCP, including:
- File request and response handling
- Data transfer using custom signals (`START`, `END`, `ERROR`)
- Basic error reporting for missing files
