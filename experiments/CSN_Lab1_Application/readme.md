üåê Application Layer Protocols Lab
This project explores the fundamentals of application-layer network protocols through three hands-on Python assignments:

HTTP Web Server
Build a basic HTTP server to handle file requests and return responses using TCP sockets.

UDP Ping Tool
Implement a UDP-based client-server system to measure round-trip time (RTT) and simulate packet loss, illustrating the behavior of unreliable transmission.

Simple FTP System
Create a lightweight TCP-based file transfer protocol (FTP) that supports basic commands and error handling for file requests between a client and server.
