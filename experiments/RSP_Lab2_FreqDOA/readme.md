## üîÅ Autocorrelation, Frequency Estimation, and DOA with Microphone Arrays

This project explores the use of autocorrelation and cross-correlation for signal analysis and enhancement. Tasks include signal denoising, frequency estimation under various noise levels, and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using both 2-mic and 8-mic arrays under different SNR conditions.
