## ðŸŒŒ Frequency Domain Processing and Image Restoration in Python

This project explores image processing in the frequency domain using Discrete Fourier Transform and implements several restoration techniques in Python. It includes spectrum visualization, ideal/Gaussian/Butterworth filters, adaptive median filtering, motion blur simulation, inverse filtering, Wiener filtering, and noise estimation.

- **Butterworth Highpass Filtering**
  - Sharpen images by preserving high-frequency components
  - Compare different highpass filters and settings

- **Adaptive Median Filtering**
  - Implement custom window-size-based adaptive median filter
  - Remove salt-and-pepper noise while preserving edges
